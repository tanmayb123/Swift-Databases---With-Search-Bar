# Swift-Databases---With-Search-Bar

Welcome to this repository.

This is the second revision of one of my most popular tutorials on YouTube, Swift Databases.

This version takes the power of the old version, and combines it with newer and better features coming out to a better app.

List of new features:
  - Search Bar

In order to use it:

1. Create the database and table on your website's phpMyAdmin section.
2. Modify the PHP End from swift databases part 1, to match your database (link: https://github.com/tanmayb123/Database-App)
3. Modify the iOS End from here, to match your PHP and Database.
4. Done! Try it out, should work. If you have any questions, suggestions etc., just contact me at:

This was written in Swift 2, Xcode 7 Beta 1 using OS X El Capitan and iOS 9. This has not been tested/written for other firmwares, however, I may release another version for Swift 1 sometime soon.

Hope you like the code!
